<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>1.—German battery “Kaiser Wilhelm II” at Knocke on Sea.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Before going into the description of the war sites along
the Belgian sea-coast, it is important to cast a general
glance on the defences established there by the Germans.</p>

<p class='c010'>Admiral Schröder was given the task of the organization
of the sea-front. To do so he had at his disposal: the
German Marine Army Corps, a coast artillery altogether
powerful in number as well as in the caliber of the guns,
a flotilla of patrolers, torpedo-boats, destroyers, submarines
and a few squadrons of aeroplanes and seaplanes.</p>

<p class='c010'>In a few months time Belgian coast, thus strongly and
thoroughly organized was to be looked upon as a real up
to date fortress. The power of the defences was mainly
concentrated round Zeebrugge and Ostend,—the two
german war outlets of the naval basis Bruges,—also
between Lombartzijde and Middelkerke,—where both
territorial and seafronts were hinged,—and finally at
Knocke and East of that locality, for the protection of
the river Schelde’s estuary.</p>

<p class='c010'>The pivot of the coast defences was to be incumbent on
the artillery acting in close cooperation with the land and
sea-forces. The artillery was to engage at long range all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>the allied boats and to keep them under a constant
crossfire, while they were endeavouring to proceed towards
the coast. For that purpose, about sixty batteries, thirty
five of which of the heaviest type were placed either along
or at the rear of the sandhills.</p>

<p class='c010'>In fact, the guns of very high caliber were distributed
behind the belt of dunes; their tactical duty was to keep
off the coast all boats which would try to carry out long
range bombardments. As those batteries could not from
their emplacements use direct fire, being unable to see the
targets, observation-posts with good field of view on the
sea—for fire registering—were found necessary. Herein
lies the reason of the construction of the numerous
concrete ones, some of them still remaining hidden along
the downs.</p>

<p class='c010'>As far as the smaller guns are concerned, these were
dug in along the dunes and were performing direct fire
to prevent against raids, attempts of landing or bottling
the harbours.</p>

<p class='c010'>Against eventual landings, the defences also comprised
a series of mine barrages, screens of nettings for submarines,
hindering the access of the shore. Redoubts
manned by infantry troops were staking out an almost
uninterrupted line of trenches which were running along
the beach, right up to the Dutch frontiers.</p>

<p class='c010'>Machine-guns and field guns were utilized for flanking
the strand and for anti-aircraft action.</p>

<p class='c010'>The German defence of the Belgian coast was completed
by high sea forces.</p>

<p class='c010'>The organization of the maritime defences was only
seriously taken in hand in 1915. The “Boat-detachement”
composed of trawlers, mine sweepers, tow boats and
barges, was formed up in February that year. Small types
of torpedo-boats and submarines were sent dismounted,
and conveyed by railway up to the dock-yards created at
Bruges, Ostend, and later on at Hoboken, where those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>units were mounted. They formed with a certain number
of other units which came directly by sea, a flotilla of submarines
and one of torpedo-boats. Motor trawlers were on
the watch far out in the sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1916, the naval forces anchored in the Flanders base
were considerably increased in number, but it was particularly
in the year 1917 that the Germans multiplied their
submarines, thus turning the harbours of Ostend and
Zeebrugge into real haunts. Shelters were built to protect
them against air raids and the numerous bombardments
carried out by the British Fleet.</p>

<p class='c010'>At Zeebrugge, the shelters were established along the
mole and in the tidal basins south of the locks and in the
Bruges canal.</p>

<p class='c010'>At Ostend, the flotillas were berthed in the wharfs and
the darses. The submarines were sheltered alongside the
marine docks.</p>

<p class='c010'>The year 1917 saw the submarine warfare ruthlessly
carried out and the enemy’s torpedo-boats raided the
British and French coast.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the early 1918, during the dismal winter nights, the
foe undertook several offensive reconnoitrings up to the
British Channel. These were to be their last deeds.</p>

<p class='c010'>Doggedly determined to bring an end to the U boats’
boundless crimes, the British Admiralty tackled the plan
for the bottling up of the two Belgian harbours. It was
thus that were performed the most astounding operations,
which took the enemy unaware, pinning him down in
Zeebrugge and almost paralysing him in Ostend.</p>

<p class='c010'>“<strong>Kaiser Wilhelm II battery</strong>” constitutes one of the typical
kind of heavy battery erected by the Germans along the
North-Sea.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span><em>Armement</em>: Four 12 inch marine guns, firing at 38 kilomètres
(23½ miles) a shell weighing more than 400 kilos,
needing a charge of 103 kilos.</p>

<p class='c010'>The tube was 17 meters 25 cm<sup>s</sup> long.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Gun crew</em>: 5 officers and 360 other ranks.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Observation-posts</em>: especially in Knocke’s Kursaal and
on the down 23 near Duinbergen.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Ammunition supply</em>: was done by railway.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Historical account</em>: the battery was armed in July 1916
but did only fire during our Flanders offensive in 1918.</p>

<p class='c010'>It fired the last time on the 18<sup>th</sup> October at about 3 p. m.

  <h2 class='c003'>2.—Germans Guns upon the jetty of Zeebrugge.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>We will not study the guns, but we feel compelled to
bring back to memory, one of the most striking naval
operations of the Great War.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>British Raid against Zeebrugge.</h3>

<p class='c012'>Loathing the countless crimes of the foe’s submarine
warfare, Admiral Sir Jellicoe, the newly promoted First
Sea Lord, brought forward a scheme for the bottling up
of Zeebrugge and Ostend, the two outlets of the German
Naval basis Bruges.</p>

<p class='c010'>The operations, though of the boldest character, was
agreed upon and attempted on April 22<sup>d</sup> 1918, eve of
S<sup>t</sup> Georges’ day, patron of England. Admiral Sir Roger Keyes
was entrusted with the glorious mission.</p>

<p class='c010'>Five old Cruisers loaded with ferro-concrete, with on
board a crew mainly composed of volunteers were to carry
that mission through. Three of these cruisers, namely:
H. M. S. <em>Thetis</em>, <em>Intrepid</em>, and <em>Iphigenia</em> were bound for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>Zeebrugge; H. M. S. <em>Brilliant</em> and <em>Sirius</em> for Ostend. A
flotilla composed of destroyers, submarines, several steam
barges and motor trawlers had to cooperate in the action.</p>

<p class='c010'>The attack against Zeebrugge seeming the more difficult
of the two had to be shouldered by the old cruiser H. M. S.
<em>Vindictive</em> and the two Liverpool carriers <em>Iris</em> and <em>Daffodil</em>.
These units were to undertake a daring diversion in
dashing for the pier.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was 5 o’clock p. m. when the fleet was concentrated
at about 63 miles off the coast and from thither directed
towards the two goals. While a wind due North East was
carrying forward a thick smoke screen produced by fume
boats, the fleet sailed forth without raising the enemy’s
attention.</p>

<p class='c010'>Unfortunately, at a few cable’s lengths from the ports
the wind suddenly swerved due South-West, cleaning away
the smoke cloud, disclosing at once the “Gallant British
Fleet”. It was then 11.56 p. m. Like lightenings, all the
guns and machine-guns, raised as though by magic power,
roared their rapid rounds.</p>

<p class='c010'>In front of Ostend, the lights guiding the boats towards
the coast were hit by shellfire and put out of action. Unable
to be driven, the attack failed. H. M. S. <em>Sirius</em> and
H. M. S. <em>Brilliant</em> were sunk at 3 kilomètres East of the
harbour’s entrance<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. The operation against Ostend was successfully carried out during
the night of the 9<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> May. H. M. S. <em>Vindictive</em> managed to place
herself athwart in the entrance of the harbour and there was blown up.</p>
</div>

<p class='c010'>In front of Zeebrugge, in spite of the infernal artillery
and machine-gun fire, sweeping the mole, H. M. S. <em>Vindictive</em>,
under captain A. F. B. Carpenter, helped by the
<em>Daffodil</em> and <em>Iris</em> managed to land his men. That diversion
brought the whole fire and the enemy’s attention up to the
mole, thus clearing the way to the blockships. Machine-gun
nests and a part of the enemy’s organizations were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>destroyed or set on fire. Little damage was done, which
after all was merely accessory.</p>

<p class='c010'>During that time, H. M. S. <em>Thetis</em> was nearing the channel.
She succeeded to cross the mine-barrage but unluckily her
propeller got entangled in the <a id='t12'></a>nets of the defences, rendering
all manœuvres impossible whatever. The commander was
then forced to blow her up after that the crew had been
taken on board of the trawlers. Her position after all
greatly helped the rapid sanding up of the harbour.</p>

<p class='c010'>H. M. S. <em>Intrepid</em> and <em>Iphigenia</em> which followed H. M. S.
<em>Thetis</em> up, overran all the obstacles and managed to enter
the canal. They placed themselves athwart in order to
block entirely the entrance up. It is then, when freed from
their crews that were embarked on board of the trawlers,
that their captains exploded charges.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was while these manœuvres were <a id='t12a'></a>on, that Lieutenant
Richard D. Sandford drove his submarine,—the C<sub>3</sub>—,
below the bays of the pier and there blew her up, making
a breach thirty meters long, thus isolating the jetty from
the coast. This last deed was to be the master piece of the
gallant expedition. The explosion had been tremendous.</p>

<p class='c010'>As soon as the three cruisers loaded with concrete had
been sunk, H. M. S. <em>Vindictive</em> re-embarked her crew and
the whole little “British Main” turned back “Homeward-Bound”.
The men of the <em>Vindictive</em> were then taken on
board of the admiral’s boat, the <em>Warwick</em>.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is one point which must be kept in mind, that is
that during the whole of these operations, the powerful
defences, switched on Zeebrugge, were thundering death
from every gun, from every rifle and machine-gun, and,
under that tornado of fire the battle area was no else but
real hell!</p>

<p class='c010'>The next day, the aerial photographs proved the wonderful
results attained by the expedition, results which were
far beyond the most optimistical previsions. In regard to
this wonderful achievement and the temerity needed to
carry it through, the casualties have shown relatively light.
From out of the 1780 officers and other ranks who took part
in the raid, 176 were killed, 412 wounded and 49 missing.</p>

<p class='c010'>This raid is the most striking instance of military valour

the glorious conduct of the British sailors and the best
way is for us to oppose the straight forwardness of the

  <h2 class='c003'>3.—German battery “Deutschland” at Breedene.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The battery “Deutschland” is situated near the Jacobinessen
farm.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Armement</em>: Four 15 inch guns firing at 55 kilometers a
shell 2 meters long.</p>

<p class='c010'>The charge was contained in a brass shell case.</p>

<p class='c010'>The tube was 17 meters 10 cm. long.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Gun crew</em>: Each gun was attended by 150 men, in
other words the whole battery was 8 officers and 600 all
ranks strong.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Observation-posts</em>: The main observation-post (concrete)
was built in Albert’s Parc; auxiliary posts were connected
to it by phones, such was the case for the one of the hotel
Belle-Vue at Wenduyne, and the other called “Fulda”
at Mariakerke.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Ammunition supply</em>: was done by railway.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Historical account</em>: The construction of the Deutschland
battery was done piece by piece and began in the early
part of September 1915.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Belgian labour was requisitioned for that work, with
Russian prisoners of war, the hands employed for that
battery amounted to seven hundred that toiled months on
end for it.</p>

<p class='c010'>The battery’s activity culminated in 1918, specially in May,
going increasingly from the 1<sup>st</sup> of June up to the 15<sup>th</sup>, 16<sup>th</sup>,
17<sup>th</sup> of October 1918. After the last fire which occurred on
the morning of the 17<sup>th</sup> of October the German disabled
the guns and left them few hours later, the battery was
then captured by our boys, on their way for victory.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>4.—German Battery “Tirpitz” at Ostend.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'><em>Armement</em>: Four 12 inch guns, firing at a range of
35 kilometers a shell weighing 375 kilos needing a charge
of 103 kilos.</p>

<p class='c010'>The tube was 12 meters 90 cms long.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Gun crew</em>: 5 officers and 400 other ranks.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Observation-posts</em>: One at Mariakerke on the roof of the
asylum, the other in the dunes.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Ammunition supply</em> was also done by railway.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Historical account</em>: The guns of this battery had been
ordered to Krupp, by the Belgian Army, in view to complete
the armement of fortified position of Antwerp. At the
outbreak of the war the German Government kept hold of
them and used them for their coast defences in Belgium.</p>

<p class='c010'>The battery was in position West of Ostend close by
Hamilton Farm. The first rounds date from September
the 7<sup>th</sup> 1915. Only two guns opened fire at that time and
during one of the firing a barrel of one of them burst causing
the death of twelve gunners; that tube was afterwards
replaced by another.</p>

<p class='c010'>On January the 24<sup>th</sup> 1916, the “Tirpitz” battery fired
a hundred shells on the Church of Nieuport and on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>old Templers’s Tower, last vestige of the first convent of
that order, which dated from the XII<sup>th</sup> century. That
destruction must have proved very satisfactory to the
German commanders, for, in recognition of that gallant
deed, iron crosses were awarded to 10 gunners of the
battery.</p>

<p class='c010'>The four guns fired for the first time in battery fire in July
the 16<sup>th</sup> 1916. The allied counter-battery work was fairly
active, mainly in 1917 and 1918. The pivot of that counter-battery
fire was formed of French 12 inch guns, mounted
on railway; these were firing from round Coxyde.</p>

<p class='c010'>On July 16<sup>th</sup> 1917 the French gunners were rather
successful, several of the guns servants were killed, shelters
were destroyed, and the men were scattered. The guns
themselves were hit by shell splinters. The top of the gun pits
were then strengthened with a bursting layer thick of one
meter of concrete, and the battery resumed its action on
the 22<sup>d</sup> of the same month.</p>

<p class='c010'>In order to deceive our observers, a dummy battery was
erected by the German at about 2 kilometers away from the
real emplacement, in the direction of Wilskerke. Two old
Belgian mortars of the 1862 type, brought from Liége, and,
four dummy guns made of wood were forming the battery.
Each time Tirpitz was firing a shot, the dummy was exploding
three successive charges, thus giving the impression
of four rounds.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another trick used by the enemy was, that whenever
the counter-battery was on, the crew was blowing up
huge fougases thus preventing the registering of the fire.</p>

<p class='c010'>The last fire occured on the 15<sup>th</sup> of October 1918, and the
battery was then destroyed.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>5.—German Admiralty Headquarters at Middelkerke.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>If the material employed for the coast defences was of
the first quality, the German took the same care for the
fitting up of the position held by the naval infantry, which
disposed of strong and numerous dug-outs, skilfully
camouflaged, in other word they formed magnificent battle
posts.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Admiralty Headquarters at Middelkerke is a wonderful
display of luxury and it emphasises their taste for
comfort.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nothing was left uncared for; in case of alarm the admiral
could easily act in complete quiétude. He had his staff
well at hand, his liaisons thoroughly assured and could
deliver his orders and instruction with the maximum
efficiency.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>6.—The “Great Redan” at Nieuport.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>From the old fortified position of Nieuport, the part
situated North of the harbour solely remained after the
dismantling had been decided by the Belgian State, in 1859.</p>

<p class='c010'>Unproperly called during the war “Great Redan”
that work—if one wants to be accurate—is formed of a
non reveted horne work which must have belonged to the
old fortification of Nieuport rebuilt in 1793, and preceded
with a half moon work constructed after 1815.</p>

<p class='c010'>The whole place, in fact, had to be reconstructed
following the Vauban system, with the funds accordingly
allotted by the Paris treaty of 1815.</p>

<p class='c010'>The abandonment of those remains of fortifications
since 1859 had evidently reduced them to mere ruins,
when the battle of the Yser was fought in 1914. If the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>“Great Redan” was not utilized during the battle as firing
line, at least it afforded a magnificent place of arms, to
shelter the reserve troops for the defence of the “Little
Bridge-head of Nieuport”.</p>

<p class='c010'>The latter place also known as the “Bridge-head of
Palingbrug” extended itself from the right bank of the
channel, at the hight of the old lighthouse to the brickwork
(Plasschendaele canal) passing by the kilometer 14.500
of the Nieuport Westende road.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is from the evening of the 20<sup>th</sup> of October 1914 onward
that the defence clung to that position.</p>

<p class='c010'>To spare his men, Lieutenant General Dossin was contrived
to flood the “Groot Noord Nieuwland Polder” up,
by letting in the seawater in to the creek of Nieuwendamme,
the dikes of which had been previously pierced. This inundation
was stretched in the evening of the 21<sup>st</sup> of October.</p>

<p class='c010'>After the epic fights at Lombarzyde and Groot Bamburg-Farm,
in which heroism was lavishly displayed by our
men, during the day and night of the 22<sup>nd</sup>, the French troops
under General Grossetti came at dawn on the 23<sup>rd</sup> to relieve
the Belgian troops in Nieuport.</p>

<p class='c010'>They were to resume the offensive movement the Belgian
troops had started, but the foe having pierced the line at
Saint-Georges and Tervaete, compelled the staff to withdraw
the troops from Nieuport to take position on the bridge-head
of Palingbrug, in order to dispose of a maximum of
reserve to be arrayed on the threatened front and also to
draft the counter-attacks which were more and more
urging.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the evening of the 26<sup>th</sup>, Colonel Claudon, commanding
the French troops at Palingbrug, judging his contingent
too weak to hold on that position, retired on the left bank
of the Channel, in doing so he gave up the bridge-head, the
Great Redan, the five bridges and the locks, in one word
that retreat meant the abandonment of the key of the
whole hydrographic system of the region.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Fortunately, the enemy not only worn out but much
more concerned with the center of his front of attack, did
not venture to keep in touch with the troops at Nieuport
and failed to notice the leaving of the right bank of the
river Yser, of which he might have so easely drawn advantage.
The German, perhaps still believing in the existence
of the fortress of Nieuport, did not attack.</p>

<p class='c010'>Up to the 3<sup>d</sup> of November 1914 the Palingbrug was
left abandoned. Though, it is during that period of time
that the inundation was stretched. A first attempt took
place on the morning of the 27<sup>th</sup> of October, but was a
failure, it is only at 5 a. m. on the 28<sup>th</sup> that we managed to
open and keep it so during the incoming tide, the old lock of
Furnes.</p>

<p class='c010'>The inroad of water through that lock having been
reckoned unsufficient, the Belgian G.H.Q. decided to make
use of the Noordvaart lock, but the latter was since the
evening of the 26<sup>th</sup> right in “No man’s land”, position
which rendered the operation most dangerous.</p>

<p class='c010'>Under the protection of 40 cyclists carabiniers who had
to cross over in walking on the Furnes lock gates (the
bridge having been blown up, by order of Colonel Claudon
after the retreat of the 26<sup>th</sup>), Captain Umé, of the Royal
Engineers successfully managed to open the locks of
Noordvaart. The following nights the operations were
renewed and gradually the sheet of water rose and rose.
Awestruck by that mystery, the enemy, fortunately realised
it but too late.</p>

<p class='c005'>At last, on the 3<sup>d</sup> of November, while the Yser battle
had proved a victory, all along the Belgian line, reconnaissances
were carried out in front of the advanced posts.</p>

<p class='c005'>On November the 4<sup>th</sup>, detachment of the 2<sup>d</sup> Army Division
occupied again the bridge-head of Palingbrug and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Redan, which we pledge our word was never tred on by
German heels.</p>

<p class='c005'>A few time afterwards an offensive movement took place
and was undertaken by the Franco-Belgian troops, that
operation forced the enemy to give up the channel North
of the “Geleïde”. The front was then fixed on a position
baptized “The Main bridge-head of Nieuport” on a line
parallel to the channel and at about 600 meters East of
the latter, running round the Western side of Lombartzyde
and prolonging itself almost parallel to Plasschendaele
canal up to the Boterdijk.</p>

<p class='c010'>That front never knew any alterations till July 1917.</p>

<p class='c005'>The 10th of July 1917, at about 8 o’clock p. m., after a
regular bombardment of more than 10 hours duration, all
along the Nieuport sector, the enemy rushed the positions
held, only since a few days, by the British Infantry. The
fight <a id='t22'></a>lasted the whole night long and after the most bloody
hand to hand fights, the attackers succeeded to enter the
British trenches between the beach and the Geleïde and
throwing the occupants in the channel, those who swam
across escaped from death or capture.</p>

<p class='c010'>From up the 11 July onward the Nieuport front was
running along the channel right up to Geleïde river, where
it was hinged to the primitive front, which determined
attacks had successfully brought to its original point.</p>

<p class='c010'>Later the “Redan” and its surrounding area were
subjected to almost daily bombardments, which soon gave
them a bloody fame.</p>

<p class='c010'>The powder-mill of the old work, thanks to the superimposed
vaults, which were forming its ceiling, managed to
resist to all kind of German shells, which made it deserve
the nickname of <em>Rubber house</em>. It was occupied during the
operations both as battle headquarters and as advanced
dressing station.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>In March 1918, the Belgian front had to be stretched
out, in order to relieve allied divisions. To avoid the weakening
of our resistance, our front having been thus considerably
lengthened and the occupation having become very
thin, the G. H. Q. decided to stretch a further inundation
which allowed to gain up several outposts.</p>

<p class='c010'>At Nieuport, the Redan became the front line. It was
hooked North by the “huitrière” (oyster-pond), fronting
the West bank of the channel, and South at “Dupuis and
de Luc” trench.</p>

<p class='c010'>Those three points d’appui formed an important point of
resistance: they were covering the locks. They were garrisoned
by a battalion; its duty was to hold at all costs and
it did it.</p>

<p class='c005'>At last, the Belgian offensive was launched from up the
southern part of our front on the 28<sup>th</sup> of September 1918.
North of Dixmude our troops remained momentarily
waiting and the position of Nieuport had still to suffer
severe bombardments. But the last occupants of the Redan
stood them up lightly, only anxiously waiting their turn
to rush victoriously over the parapet. The kick off was
given on the 17<sup>th</sup> of October and the very same day they were
able to admire with a legitimate pride the magnificent
enemy artillery, which had made them suffer so much and
that the Germans had left them, the guns still loaded.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>7.—Karnak battery at Oost-Dunkerke.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>English battery composed of two <a id='t23'></a>9.2 inches, guns. That
battery was situated at about 1 kilometer East of Oost-Dunkerke
and at 200 meters South of Oost-Dunkerke bath
and Nieuport bath road.</p>

<p class='c010'>Its interest lies in the reason of its having been constructed
underneath the great dunes, from that emplacement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>the battery drew the three fold advantages in regard to
camouflage, protection and mainly in creating great difficulties
to the German counter-battery; indeed the latter was
deprived of any aiming point whatever, and the shell craters
were rapidly leveled up by the sand.</p>

<p class='c010'>Karnak battery, which was manned by British gunners
had been placed under the Orders of the O. C. of the Nieuport
sector, who utilized it for momentous counter-battery
and destruction fires.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>Ramscappelle was the only point West of the Nieuport-Dixmude
railway line that ever was trod on by the invader.
After the taking of St-Georges on October 24<sup>th</sup> 1914, the
foe in order to widen his success rushed on the 26<sup>th</sup> for the
Noordvaart and compelled our troops after a night of
fierce struggle to withdraw on the railway track, on
which they clung without much difficulty up to the
29<sup>th</sup> of October.</p>

<p class='c010'>During the evening of the 29<sup>th</sup>, two attempts of the enemy
against the railway line facing Ramscappelle failed. The
30<sup>th</sup>, at 4.45 a. m. a new trial was again pinned down.
And finally round 5.30 a. m. after a terrific artillery
preparation, a last and more powerful attack than the
previous ones, forced the resistance at a point South of the
halt of Ramscappelle, the enemy linked himself on the
railway line which he now enfilades and thus proceeding
northward, reached the village.</p>

<p class='c010'>The 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> line Regiments, which had battled with
the finest determination, withdrew and took a strong position
at the Koolhofbrug and Jockveld farm from whither
they managed to prevent the enemy to emerge from out
the village, thus stemming the rush for good and all.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Lieutenant General Dossin, in command of the 2<sup>d</sup> Army
Division, ordered the counter-strike to be organized at
once. Accordingly at the beginning of the afternoon a force
composed of four French Battalions and five Belgian ones
plus a machine-gun company, and, with in support two
Belgian and two French battalions, went slowly forward,
encircled the village altogether northward, westward and
southward. When that move had been completed, the
assault was launched; it was then 7 o’clock p. m.</p>

<p class='c010'>The group of houses on the southern side of the wind
mill and the wind mill itself were carried out at the first
jump, thanks to the fighting spirit of the men and also to
the efficient artillery fire of N<sup>o</sup> 26<sup>th</sup> Belgian Field Battery,
which, in spite of a hurricane of machine-gun bullets had
been brought as far forward as the Pelican bridge.</p>

<p class='c010'>The fighting ground being of a very close nature permitted
but a very slow progression of the wings. But
nothing daunted, the attack however reached the nearer
outskirts of the village, bar the eastern side of the brook,
called Ramscapelleleed excepted.</p>

<p class='c010'>The night was spent in carrying out violent musketry
fire, and to goad the enemy several reconnaissances were
pushed in the village while a section of a French and
Belgian bridging company was erecting a foot bridge on
the Ramscappelleleed. The artillery kept hammering the
enemy’s defences into ruins.</p>

<p class='c010'>At dawn of the 31<sup>th</sup> of October, the german resistance
weakened and a general attack carries the village up
bringing in one jump the assaulting troops right up the
railway line, scattering the remaining defenders and
pushing them back toward the river Yser.</p>

<p class='c010'>The german fled, leaving their dead and wounded
behind them, they also abandoned in the inundation the
two famous “Minenwerfer”, which only seven days ago had
annihilated a whole Belgian battalion, which was defending
the Yser crossing at the Union Bridge.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>During the whole war, the Nieuport-Dixmude railway
line formed in the “Ramscappelle sector”, the main line of
resistance. When the water had retired a little, the sector
<a id='t26'></a>was guarded by two main-guards i. e. Rijkenhoek and
Beverdijk, particularly famous as kick off points for the
numerous attacks and raids of our troops against the
Violette and Terstille farms.</p>

<p class='c010'>That line offered numerous and well constructed shelters
affording to our men relatively comfortable dwellings. Here
and there, at places offering good field of fire or permitting
to sweep main-traffic passages concrete machine pits (such
as the one at the station) were built. In the hut of the
railway guard an artillery observation-post was also
constructed.</p>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>10.—Observation-post at the Pervyse railway station.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>From up the 26<sup>th</sup> of October 1914, date at which our
troops were compelled to leave the Beverdijk, the Dixmude
railway track outlined in front of Pervyse our first front
line.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the 30<sup>th</sup> of October meanwhile the foe was rushing
for Ramscappelle he hurled detachments against the
Pervyse station. That attack miserably failed under the
violent rifle firing of the 1<sup>st</sup> Battalion of the 12<sup>th</sup> line Regiment
which had been swiftly reinforced by few sections of
the 2<sup>d</sup> Bat.</p>

<p class='c010'>The assailants fled seeking refuge in the houses bordering
the Schoore road opposite the railway station, where
they were made prisoner in the course of the day. The rest
managed to retire back to their former position but had to
fight their way through the inundation in order to rally
their line.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>The above assault was to be the only one the first line
of Pervyse ever had to grapple with.</p>

<p class='c010'>The main-guard of Schilderbrug with its advanced posts,
(one outlook post on the road and two sentry posts on the
water with the intermediate ones) gave the troops a sufficient
security to allow the men, in spite of the rafale fires
which from time to time poured upon the line, to say:
“It is fine in Pervyse”.</p>

<p class='c010'>The line was organized since the early days of its
occupation, then was gradually improved to become during
the last years of war a model of stabilized trench warfare
area.</p>

<p class='c010'>Even the station itself, where an artillery observation-post
had been constructed, was wedged in a powerful
stronghold whose solid concrete shelters for machine-guns
were forming the bastions.</p>

<p class='c010'>One of the above mentioned machine-gun pits, that of
the south eastern angle may still be seen and will give a
thorough idea of the organization.</p>

<p class='c010'>The observation-post of the railway station, one of the
main O. P. s. of the Belgian front, had a vast field of
view and was provided with visual apparatus of the highest
precision.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was connected in 1917, by means of two telephone
wires with alternative courses, to Dunkirk signalling post
and that, in order to warn the city of the firing intended
for her by the Leugenboom gun.</p>

<p class='c010'>The report of the monster, perceived at Pervyse was at
once communicated to Dunkirk where the receiving station
was to alert the town by means of the powerful steam-whistles
or other such alarm signals.</p>

<p class='c005'>That concrete dug-out served as battle Headquarters to
the major commanding the Oud-Stuyvekenskerke subsector.
It was of that type adopted for such shelters
prompted along the railway line.</p>

<p class='c010'>These emplacements were generally constructed in the
years 1916 and 1917 to take the place of the far less
resisting ones whose walls as well as roofings were formed
by beams and logs in juxtaposition. The roof had been
rendered waterproof by means of <a id='t30'></a>tarred board, while a
more or less thick layer of bags filled with concrete rendered
them safe against small shells.</p>

<p class='c010'>These which replaced them, some of which are still
remaining such that of kilom. 4.400, were very well
conceived. They often contained several different rooms,
the number of which were varying according the need of
the sector: major’s orderly room, major’s and adjutant’s
lodging, visual signalling and very-light posts, telephone
central, etc....</p>

<p class='c005'>The old tower of Oud-Stuyvekenskerke has not been able
to resist to the amount of projectiles poured upon it by
the Germans, throughout the whole campaign. Its emplacement
however, and the concrete bloc which has taken
its place are interesting as marking the extreme advance
of the enemy in the region, it also brings back to memory
the terrific bombardments and fights which that corner of
Flanders witnessed.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>At the end of the Yser battle, after the 29<sup>th</sup> of
October 1914, Oud-Stuyvekenskerke was only occupied for
a few days by weak German detachements, whilst our line
of defence had been brought back upon the Nieuport-Dixmude
railway line and rejoining the Yser at the
kilometer 16 by a line running through Roode-Poort
farm and the houses of the Burg.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then the flood forced the foe to withdraw up to the
bank of the river.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the 3<sup>rd</sup> of November 1914, the Belgian G. H. Q.
ordered to push forward reconnaitring parties all along
our army front; advanced posts were then placed which,
little by little were multiplied untill they formed a complete
defence line of advanced guards, acting as outposts screen
to the whole defence scheme. The main-guards were all
on duty beyond the inundations, the mean of access to the
main-guards being long duck boards placed on threstle
stuck in the soil. The one leading to Oud-Stuyvekenskerke
was particularly dangerous because the Germans had
aimed a fixed rifle on it, which was sweeping its whole
length. The losses there sustained have been very heavy,
mainly when relieves were on. To cut the casualties down
the 4<sup>th</sup> line Regiment erected concrete shields against
bullets and shell splinters.</p>

<p class='c010'>The main-guard of Oud-Stuyvekenskerke was protecting
the left flanc of the organization of the Dixmude sector
and that by keeping under its fire the whole of the
ground stretching itself in front of their advanced posts.
Besides, the hamlet which was situated on a little knoll,
was thus affording great advantages for the creation of
observation-posts.</p>

<p class='c010'>In connection with this “War-Site” there is a name
which is closely associated with every details of its life.
Known as the “Burgomaster of Oud-Stuyvekenskerke”,
R. Father Martial Lekeux, Artillery Commander, spent
the first years of the war in the tower, then when latter
tumbled down, he moved in the gable front of a farm where
he organized a remarkable observation-post. The name of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>Martial Lekeux deserves to be mentioned here, because
his dogged determination and pluck, unidentified themselves
with that main-guard of Oud-Stuyvekenskerke.</p>

<p class='c010'>Three momentous German posts, were facing it, i. e. the
farms n<sup>o</sup> 1, “den Toren and Van de Woude”, which
owed many a tragic days to the keen eyes of the Belgian
observer.</p>

<p class='c010'>For four years on end of trench warfare the main-guard
of Oud-Stuyvekenskerke held fast. It held under storms
of iron, it held against assailants who, at renewed
attempts endeavoured to overrun it. These different rushes,
the one of March 1918 against our cyclist carabiniers and
the 1<sup>st</sup> foot jagers as well as that of June of the same year
against the 22<sup>nd</sup> line regiment have disclosed the stubborn
energy and enthusiastic courage which moved our men of
1918, classing them amongst the best fighting elements of
the great allied armies.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>13.—Death Trench and the “Cavalier” field work.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>When the battle of the Yser was over, our first front line
was running along the river in front of Dixmude in a
direction due North-West up to the kilometer 16. There
the river Yser, makes a sudden bend and our front was
leaving the river side to prolonge itself westward, leaning
on the Roode-Poort farm thus joining the Nieuport-Dixmude
railway line.</p>

<p class='c010'>That particular point of kilometer n<sup>o</sup> 16, which ought to
have been on the early days of stabilized warfare, a stronghold
of our defensive scheme, struck our high command,
as being rather weak. The decision was then taken to
strengthen it.</p>

<p class='c010'>A line of main-guards already covered the Belgian
positions from Nieuport up to Oud-Stuyvekenskerke, when
General Jacquet decided, in order to cover himself at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>kilometer n<sup>o</sup> 16, to prolonge that line by adding to it an
element, the advanced posts of which would be placed
along the river Reigersvliet and that right up to its mouth.</p>

<p class='c010'>To carry that mission through it was thought necessary
to rush the petrol tanks, the mystery of which, more than
their power had already given to the sector a fair renown.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Death trench and Riders’work-Operations which took place from up May to October 1915 North and East of kilometer 16 of the river Yser.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The 1<sup>st</sup> foot jagers, shouldered by the 3<sup>rd</sup> divisional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>artillery and accompanied by detachements of pioneers, tried
the operations.</p>

<p class='c010'>A keen fight developed for three long days, from up
the 9<sup>th</sup> to the 12<sup>th</sup> May 1915<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a>, in a horrible ground, the
main part being under water, and cut up by deep and broad
ditches and shell holes full of water, offering no shelter
whatever to the rafales of machine-guns and the harassing
fires of the artillery which were hacking our gallant boys
down. The attack failed in spite of their courage, and the
losses endured.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. At the same time, the 3<sup>d</sup> foot jagers began the fight on the right
bank, succeeding to establish a bridge-head South-East of kilometer 16.
The enemy clung against it and the daily casualties were such that it was
decided to reduce its development and manning. In 1917 few portions of
trenches running along the right bank remained solely held and were
the starting point of the raids carried on against the enemy’s organizations,
right up to the end of the war. A few shelters, last witnesses of
our occupation, are still standing and will be kept up for the future.</p>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The 1<sup>st</sup> foot jagers alone had lost in that action 10 officers
and five hundred and fifty men, killed or wounded. The
plan was not given up, but tactics was changed. The ground
which had been captured was hurriedly fitted up, while a
platoon of a tunneling company was set at task on the bank
of the Yser to resume the advance by sap-work. The
mining was progressing satisfactorily when it was realized
that on the German side a similar work was on, which, in
less than a fortnights time reduced to few yards the distance
separating the Belgian saphead from the enemy’s.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the 27<sup>th</sup> of May 1915, during the relieve, and taking
the advantage of a pitch dark night and protected by a
violent bombardment, a group of Germans jumped in our
trench placing a machine-gun section in it. The enfilading
fire of those guns caused heavy casualties to the 9<sup>th</sup> line
regiment which delivered a counter-attack.</p>

<p class='c010'>After useless efforts, the only alternative left was to push
actively forward the organization of the remaining portion
of the trench so as to render it able to resist, notwithstanding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>the achievement of the previous object, it is to
say the strengthening of the Yser salient at kilometer 16.</p>

<p class='c010'>From time to time, the enemy tried to attack the trench
but each time was repulsed by spontaneous counter-strokes.
The enormous casualties suffered, either by the bombardments
or by the numerous raids, carried out by the enemy,
against the trench, made it deserve the name of: “Death
Trench”. (Boyau de la Mort.)</p>

<p class='c010'>In September 1915, the more urgent works of the Death Trench
were nearly finished and could easely suffice to the
defence of the left bank of the river at kilometer n<sup>o</sup> 16.
The attention of the engineers was then driven on to the
construction of the “Cavalier”, work which was to complete
the above mentioned defence, by securing it against all
attempts of the enemy to cross the river.</p>

<p class='c010'>The characteristic features of the “Cavalier” comes from
the working condition it had to be submitted to, it is to
say, to combine the defence as to fit or better to match in
the most perfect way to the one of the “Death trench”
thus forming a center of the highest possible resistance.</p>

<p class='c010'>The “Cavalier” in itself presents two different and
parallel lines, the first one on the level with the ground,
to serve the purpose of round way and communication
line, the second, above level thus dominating the whole
region. The latter trench is the firing one, the overlooking
position of which permitting to carry out enfilading and
plunging fires upon the two banks of the river Yser as
well as in the Death Trench itself, and on the enemy’s
organization round kilometer n<sup>o</sup> 16.</p>

<p class='c010'>The dead angles of that position were under machine-gun
fire and later, automatic rifles were placed at the
entrance of the Death Trench, and also in the one connecting
it with the “Cavalier”.</p>

<p class='c010'>The building up of the “Cavalier” was long and cost to
our sappers and infantrymen many a toilsome days and
many a casualties. Seeing those provoking works, the
German indeed did not remain inactive, they frequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>ruined our works with their artillery and minenwerfers,
inflicting to our troops awful losses.</p>

<p class='c010'>The close of 1915 marked the end of the grounding of
the accessory defences. The emplacements for trench
mortars, machine-guns pits were rising little by little, the
dug-out for the officer in Command of the “Cavalier” sector,
was gradually coming to shape, and the shelters were
rising from out the soil.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was then decided to reduce the occupation of the
“Death Trench”.</p>

<p class='c010'>On October 11<sup>th</sup> 1915, the bank of the Yser was blown up
by a mine at about 275 meters in front of kilometer 16,
thus opening a gap 6 or 8 meters in length, which connected
the Yser to the flooded area. The Northern portion of the
trench was filled up and then abandoned.</p>

<p class='c010'>Three bombing teams, garrisoned by day time the thus
shortened line.</p>

<p class='c010'>Our men had become first class bomb throwers and
feeling themselves well shouldered by the Van Deuren
mortars (Belgian Stokes Guns) were full of confidence and
never feared their opponents.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1916 the organization of the “Cavalier” completes
itself and becomes a real redoubt. The two flights of the
work is provided with offensive and defensive weapons,
as well as with liaison material of the most diverse nature.
Concrete shelters for the men have taken the place of those
built with logs, which so often were bombed to ruins by
the enemy. A post of visual signalling was placed so as to
maintain a constant contact with the commander of the sector.</p>

<p class='c010'>May 1916 was to be a tragic month for the kilometer 16
sector.</p>

<p class='c010'>From up the 2<sup>nd</sup> on to the 22<sup>nd</sup>, the German switched on
the “Death Trench” a fire of the most terrific power, and
hurling troops forward they managed to get a foot-hold in
our position, but nothing daunted, a counter-attack winged
them at once back, by dint of grenades fights and sharp
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>hand to hand struggles.... The enemy fled, he had not even
had time to take his dead and wounded back with him.</p>

<p class='c010'>In July 1916, an artillery observation-post was established
at the “Cavalier”. The camouflage section came and
erected there a strong steel cabin, loopholed towards the
enemy side, and also provided with a periscope. A telephone
wire was connecting that post to the Divisional Artillery
Commander.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the month of may with its <a id='t39'></a>hard and bloody days the
men had to contend with, were not to be forgotten, and a
keen wish for vengeance was nursed by every one.</p>

<p class='c010'>Was the No “One” enemy trench not presenting itself
to us in a similar way as our “Death Trench” to him? In
fact, we were on the bridge-head on the right bank. The
attack and destruction of that line was decided.</p>

<p class='c010'>On July 18<sup>th</sup> 1916, after that several reconnaissances had
made during the preceding nights, and thorough destruction
fire switched on to the trench, a detachment of n<sup>o</sup> 4 company
of the IV<sup>th</sup> Bat. of the 2<sup>nd</sup> line Regiment, under the
command of Lieutenants Loyse and Desenfans stormed it.
The object of the raid was not to remain there, but the duty
of the raiding-party was to “clean the place up” and keep
it free of Germans a sufficient length of time to blow all the
concrete shelters up, to render them unhabitable. The
“cleaning up” was thoroughly done, but unfortunately
Lieutenant Loyse having been dangerously wounded, could
not give the signal which was to start the blowing of the
charges, that sapper sergeant Billiet had placed, after
having himself taken an ample share in the first part of the
show.</p>

<p class='c010'>This raid is recorded as an example of the kind. All the
dead and wounded of the party were brought back to our
lines.</p>

<p class='c010'>The enthusiasm was at its highest, the confidence
kindled, the regiment avenged.</p>

<p class='c010'>The sector was calm for a good while.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>The 17<sup>th</sup> of October 1916, the German, roused once again,
opened on our line, at kilometer 16, the most powerful
bombardment, foreboding a new attack. But our gunners
were on the watch, they directed at once a counter-bombardment
so violently efficient that it must have taken out
from the enemy’s mind the slightest wish to jump out of
his haunts.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ten days later, the 2<sup>d</sup> line regiment decided to do away
with the “One” enemy trench, for good and all. From up
the 27<sup>th</sup> on to the 31<sup>st</sup> of October detachment raided by night
the accursed trench, they undertook the destruction of the
shelters, turning the whole of No “One” line into real havoc.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the course of the years 1917 and 1918, the life at the
kilometer 16 quietened down, the intervals between the
bombardments and mortar duals lengthened, and were
replaced by intermittant artillery and hand grenades fights.</p>

<p class='c010'>The “Cavalier and Death Trench” received then their
final improvements. The first observation cabin having been
demolished by gun fire, on April the 4<sup>th</sup> 1917, a new one
in concrete took its place, the upper trench became a platform,
the liaison and signal post provided with ground
telegraphy. The automatic rifles and bomb throwers
multiplied.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Death Trench was provided with an alternative
straight communication line. A light wooden railway track
was layed, to enable transport and evacuation by means of
the small trucks. Numerous “concrete-brick” shelters
were created.</p>

<p class='c010'>Finally the head of the trench was turned into a deathtrap,
surrounded by wolf’s holes and barbed wires, that
point was only manned by day time by snipers sheltered in
a small concrete sentry box.</p>

<p class='c010'>The trap was separated from the death trench by a
monolithe concrete dug-out of a rather peculiar shape.
That shelter was fitted with a heavy steel door, and loopholed
to enable hand grenade throwing and automatic rifle’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>firing. A vibrating connected the little redoubt with the
Commander of the “Cavalier”.</p>

<p class='c010'>In case that the enemy managed to enter the trap or to
reach our trench, the garrison of the fortlet was to shut
itself up in it and resist from within during a length of
time sufficient to be relieved by a counter-attack delivered
by the “Cavalier” which had been alerted by the buzzer.</p>

<p class='c010'>During the Franco-British offensive of October 1917
numerous fires were carried out by our artillery to prepare
the eventual cooperation of the Belgian forces. That
artillery action brought on to us energetic retaliations
which did a lot of damages to the line at Roode-Poort.</p>

<p class='c010'>The numerous raids of our troops in the German lines
proved the efficiency of our fire, which had reduced the
enemy’s trenches to mere ruins.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the 1917 offensive was stopped the life resumed its
normal and dull course; the 5<sup>th</sup> infantry division was set
at work to repair the damages and restore to our positions
their former power.</p>

<p class='c010'>Our attack of September 1918 had a repercussion upon
the whole sector overlooked by the Cavalier.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first battle had brought the Belgian Army on the
Clercken ridge. The intention to hinge the new front to the
old one including the Dixmude town, induced the 5<sup>th</sup> line
Regiment to get hold of Trench “One”, “111”, as well as of
the first work North of Dixmude. And this was to be the
only alteration brought on the front round kilometer 16.</p>

<p class='c010'>From the 15<sup>th</sup> to the 17<sup>th</sup> of October, under the victorious
onrush of the second battle, the front was split up from
Nieuport to Dixmude and the Germans were compelled to
a hurried retreat.</p>

<p class='c010'>The front of the Yser was definitively cleared, the Rider
and the Death Trench had ended their glorious mission.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is important to note the powerful organizations of the
enemy, facing the “Death Trench”, notably the enormous
concrete of German sap-heads on the leftbank of the Yser,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>with their iron-plated loopholes and firing ranges, overlooking
all the surrounding districts.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Rider is a work of the greatest interest. It may be
considered as a small museum concerning the trench warfare.
In the minimum space it utilized in a most judicious
way all defensive and offensive implement such as accessory
defences and all kinds of liaison systems, which were
coordinated to bring the highest efficiency.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was also the witness of the magnificent and sustained
stoïcism on the part numerous Belgian soldiers who succeeded
each other to defend it.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Death Trench is a sacred spot, sacred by the acts of
courage and heroism that were accomplished there, and
sacred by the blood that was shed here, it is the tomb of
hundreds of brave heroes.</p>

<p class='c005'>These two shelters mark out the portion of the Belgian
front which suffered the most by German bombardment
with trench-mortars shells and bombs.</p>

<p class='c010'>During the dreadful days of May 1916, our first line,
facing Dixmude was subjected to awful firing; the embankment
of the Yser, behind which our men were sheltered,
was overthrown, the shelters broken down, the relief posts
destroyed. All the work of the trenches which had taken
eighteen months of patient toil to erect was annihilated in
a few days and transformed into a horrible chaos. Hundreds
of brave soldiers were torn to pieces by the bursting
of German trench mortar shells, the effects of which were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>so terrible that in falling they dug craters of 10 meters
diameter, thus smashing up the strongest shelters, and
crushing and burying under the ruins all those who had
taken refuge there. After the storm calmed down (and it
was only calmed when our mortars arrived, affording us
then the opportunity to juggle with those of the adversary),
the Belgian soldiers with their habitual tenacity, undertook
to rebuild their defensive works. Night and day, they worked
patiently and obstinately on, and in the face of the
enemy which was watching them from the opposite side of
the bank, managed ruins out of the ruins that were accumulated
there, to erect new lines of defence, stronger and
better established than the first. They were composed, besides
firing parapets for infantrymen, of numerous shelters
for snipers and machine-gunners, rest and waiting shelters,
relief posts, fighting battle posts for unit commanders, etc....
Earth, wood, iron, concrete, all were put together and used
to constitute a formidable entrenched line, which was held
till the end of the war.</p>

<p class='c010'>From amongst these numerous shelters, two have been
preserved: the first at the South of the Bridge-rail of
Dixmude, is situated in the centre of the bend formed by
the Yser in front of the town. The second was used as a
fighting post for the commander of the company entrusted
to defend the portion of the embankment, situated in front
of the Handzaeme Canal. That particular point was specially
momentous and to be watched, because it meant
there to forbid the inroad in our lines of the Germans
troops, which, under the cover of the Handzaeme canal
banks, could, mounted on little boats <a id='t43'></a>berthed at Dixmude,
try a landing on the West bank of the river Yser.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>15.—The Flour-Mill of Dixmude.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>How can one recall the battle of Dixmude without having
before one’s eyes the vision of the flour-mill rising far
above the ruins of the little Flemish town? One saw it in
spite of oneself; in fact nearly always one felt its presence.
During the four years of trench warfare it was the
vigilant eye watch of the enemy. An eye with a look of
fire and iron. An eye which had the command over powerful
artillery, over numerous minenwerfers, and even over
simple snipers who coldly struck down the imprudent and
foolhardy ones who ventured to brave it, very often without
being aware of it.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the beginning of the war, a legend ran that the massif
construction of the corn-mill was built by the Germans.
The authorised opinion of E. Hosten in his book entitled
<cite>the Agony of Dixmude</cite> gives the lie to this assertion in the
following terms: “It is quite evident at the present day
that the platform of the huge cube of cement which formed
the corn-mill of Dixmude was not erected on the shore of
the Yser, solely to receive heavy German artillery which
from that matchless observatory could have overlooked
and swept-away all the surroundings”.</p>

<p class='c010'>During the tragic days of the battle of the Yser (from the
17<sup>th</sup> to the 31<sup>st</sup> of October 1914) the bridge-head, created
round Dixmude was preserved in spite of the many furious
assaults of the enemy. It was the witness each day, each
hour even, of incredible and superhuman tenacity and
endurance on the part of the Belgian and French troops.
Those brave soldiers were commanded by energetic,
resolute and iron willed chiefs, whose fame has long classed
them among the most accomplished men of the war. Let
us suffice to mention the celebrated and famous names of
Ronarch, Meiser and Jacques.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>The corn-mill, in this position acted the double part of
observatory and shelter for the defensive reserves. An
observer connected with Colonel De Vleeschouwer, who was
in command of the Belgian artillery in front of Dixmude,
could, while placed on the platform of the building, direct
the firing on all telling points, such as batteries of the
enemy in action, troops on the march, preparations for
attacks, etc....</p>

<p class='c010'>The enemy did not allow our artillery such an advantage
for long; the corn-mill was partly taken by the German
batteries, which took great pleasure in directing blazing
fires on that colossal building. The observer was forced
to abandon his post, but nevertheless not without the
satisfaction of having registered to the best advantage and
conditions the first fires of our artillery.</p>

<p class='c010'>The corn-mill, from that time, was simply utilized as
the nest for the reserves of the bridge-head. A company,
to which a platoon was sometimes added, composed its
garrison.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>⁂</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The night of the 25<sup>th</sup> to the 26<sup>th</sup> of October 1914 was
marked, in the resistance of Dixmude, by a unique and
singular incident.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the evening of the 25<sup>th</sup>, groups of Germans had
managed to creep into the intervening spaces of the trenches,
situated between the railway line of Zarren and the road
leading to Eessen, trenches which were guarded by troops
physically exhausted, whose lines were considerably
weakened by ten days of cruel and outrageous fighting.
These groups of enemies formed themselves up again inside
our lines. The night was as black as ink, and unfortunately
the guns on the road of Eessen were jammed.</p>

<p class='c010'>As soon as Lieutenant Simon of the 12<sup>th</sup> line was informed
of the incident by one of his men, he immediately directed
an intensive fire on the Germans, putting a great number
out of the field. The others reformed on the road. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>were about three hundred. Headed by the Major and
accompanied by an enervating music of fifes, they penetrated
in the town, firing on all lited points, such as fighting
posts, shelters for troops, relief posts, killing and capturing
on their passage all small and isolated groups of French and
Belgian soldiers who were taken prisoners and forced to
march in front to serve as shields.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thanks to this infamous trick the German column arrived
without incident as far as the bridge road. The latter was
crossed by the allied soldiers followed up by the Germans,
the Major included. The machine-gunners of the bridge
only perceived their mistake when a hundred pick helmets
had already passed over. They then opened a muzzle to
muzzle fire on the rest of the column which went whirling
over and was scattered in the town, leaving numerous dead
and wounded on the pavement.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the meanwhile the troops of the bridge-head were
living the most thrilling moments of the battle. Nevertheless
though much unnerved, they were maintained at their post,
thanks to the marvelous calm and heroical energy of the
officers who examined and rectified the occupation of the
trenches.</p>

<p class='c010'>And then, what an unutterable relief to the troops and
their chiefs when they heard the guns firing on the bridge
road proclaiming loudly that the line of the Yser still held
good and that it had not been taken unawares!</p>

<p class='c010'>Till dawn, the front of the bridge-head had to face at
the same time, the positions of the enemy, and the town.
It was not necessary. The Germans who had crossed the
bridge, marched on at random. At a little distance at the
East of the halt at Caeskerke, they soon ran up against a
company of the 12<sup>th</sup> of the line in reserve. (The C. P. of
the admiral was composed of a group of cyclist carabiniers
re-enforced by their runners). Without fighting the enemy
detachment turned South across the fields, and fell, without
knowing, on our batteries and would have surprised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>them without help when fortunately the detachment was
taken between the fires of several groups of French and
Belgian soldiers and was encircled without difficulty. Not
quick enough though, to prevent the said detachment of
committing the most abominable crime: the massacre
without mercy and without distinction of their prisoners.</p>

<p class='c010'>Taken prisoners in their turn, the Germans could have
been judged according to the regulations and an avalanche
of shot would have sufficed to have stretched them out. But
we were struggling for the Right; brought before Admiral
Ronarch, he decided to have executed militarily the
Germans who had shown themselves the most cruel in the
massacre; three amongst these, recognized by the Belgian
doctor Van der Ghinst, who had been taken prisoner during
the night, and had escaped by miracle, were shot on the
spot, the others were sent to the back.</p>

<p class='c010'>As for the part of the German column which had not
been able to cross the bridge, this was taken under the
fires of the guns, and was, as we have already said,
dispersed in all directions, endeavouring to seek refuge in
the houses at Dixmude. The reserve garrisoned in the flour
mill, awaken by the noise of the fighting and being at once
acquainted with the situation, remained in place, ready to
intervene.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Germans, who tempted to take refuge in the corn-mill
were shot down without ceremony, and at daylight
patrols were sent in the town to search the houses, and
arrest all those who were hidden there. The nightmare was
ended, and confidence revived more than ever.</p>

<p class='c010'>This trick of the Germans, which might have figured in
their war annals, as a glorious page, simply lengthened the
list of their crimes. On the other hand, it set of more than
ever the admirable qualities of the French and Belgian
armies: the confidence of the troops in their chiefs, their
character and above all their generosity perhaps somewhat
exaggerated when addressed to individuals deformed
by a barbarous “Kultur”.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>The action of the bridge-head ended with the battle of
the Yser, the 1<sup>st</sup> of November 1914; anyhow for reasons
purely moral, it was still kept there. The occupying troops
were reduced.</p>

<p class='c010'>The defensive artillery was also reduced in too large
proportions owing to the reason that a great quantity of
pieces had been disabled, moreover the munitions were
deficient. Many empty ammunition limbers could not be
replenished, already for several days the wants surpassed
the means of supply.</p>

<p class='c010'>The days of the 9<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> of November 1914 marked out
the agony of Dixmude which began by a general bombardment
of great violence, to which our twenty guns of 7c5,
with only the aid of a few heavy french guns, could but
attempt a retaliation.</p>

<p class='c010'>The 3<sup>d</sup> battalion of the 1<sup>st</sup> line regiment and two battalions
of Singalese kept the bridge-head.</p>

<p class='c010'>The 10<sup>th</sup>, about 7 o’clock, a first German assault failed
before our lines, to the great astonishment of the enemy
who was convinced that he had annihilated all our defences.</p>

<p class='c010'>His plan of attack had to be completely altered. The
XXII<sup>th</sup> army corps of reserve was charged with this mission.
Three convergent columns took the South and East sectors
as though in pincers. The artillery carried on an infernal fire,
casting and sowing death in the trenches, in the town and
on all accessible roads to our reserves.</p>

<p class='c010'>The South sector resisted, the East one also, but unfortunately
a portion of the trench, situated between the railway
line and the road, and only guarded by the dead and wounded
could no longer keep back the enemy who rushed the
position and took it back handed. Then began a most
terrific fight, the memory of which makes the ancients
shudder. It was a serie of hand to hand fights, individual
fights with the bayonet in the streets, in the houses, in the
trenches, leaving on the ground at every step, the blood of
the vanquisher as well as the vanquished.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>Unfortunately the admiral disposes of no reserves at hand.
He cannot untrim the bank of the Yser which will have
to face the attack if continued, and endeavour to bar the
crossing of the river.</p>

<p class='c010'>And that is why under the pressure of numbers and
after several hours of bloody struggle, the defenders of the
bridge-head were forced to concentrate themselves in the
corn-mill and in the trench preceding it. During several
hours it is a resistance, where the resolute and determined
courage of a few men, held the head to a numerous enemy
which was struck down in heaps.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the meantime, the bridging company had placed a
foot bridge across the Yser at the western side of the corn-mill
thus permitting the last defenders of Dixmude to cross
the river, sheltered from the front fires of the infantry.</p>

<p class='c010'>All our men re-entered the corn-mill. The order for the
general retreat arrived. It was four o’clock p. m.</p>

<p class='c010'>With heavy hearts, those brave troops who had fought
like lions and who were determined to the last sacrifice
leave their fortress of one day cast a last look on the smoking
ruins of the town, on the corn-mill, which in its turn
begins to burn (the fire was set during the defence by a
french soldier), send a last and pious thought to all the
gallant heroes who have just bravely fallen for their country,
and the river is crossed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Twenty-two officers and a large number of soldiers were
missing at the roll call on the left bank.</p>

<p class='c010'>The German attack attempts again the passage of the
Yser, but it is annihilated. The artillery thunders, all the
time, but the infantry holds, and will hold till the end.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus were the last spasms of the battle of the Yser, and
the trench warfare begins.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>⁂</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The Germans occupied Dixmude and the corn-mill. Our
first line was staked out on the West of the Yser. From one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>end to the other, positions were organized, fortified and
armed according to the constant progress of the science of
the new war, which transformed the sectors into real fortresses,
whose smallest corners hid instruments of death.</p>

<p class='c010'>The corn-mill did not escape German organization.
Strong, it was already, but it was rendered undestroyable.
The walls were used as lock ups for tons of concrete in
the midst of which were disposed a series of shelters and
posts of observation, which had nothing to fear even from
the most enormous projectiles.</p>

<p class='c010'>The corn-mill was a source of great suffering to our
troops, not only by the watchmen, but by the minenwerfers
that it sheltered. Our artillery made many desperate
attempts to attack it. It only managed to round its cubic
forms and to pulverize certain points of its bulk, but that
was all.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>⁂</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>During the Franco-British offensive from August to October
1917, our staff thought, at a certain moment to be able
to extend on our front the progression of the Allies. It was
at the time of the long artillery preparations. Our batteries,
re-enforced by numerous guns of heavy calibre of the allied
armies, executed a systematic hammering on the enemy’s
front, which after a few days enabled us to believe that the
works of the enemy had been absolutely and thoroughly
annihilated.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was decided to ascertain and see the state of the upheaval.
Consequently raids were undertaken on all the
beaten front. They were a great success, except at the flour-mill.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the nights of the 28<sup>th</sup> to 29<sup>th</sup> of October, on the 3<sup>d</sup> and
4<sup>th</sup> of November 1917, detachments of the 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> of the
line regiment crossed the Yser with magnificent spirit. The
South and North trenches of the flour-mill were cleaned out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>without great difficulty, but when the detailed group attacked
the flour-mill, there was a reaction, and a painful one
which cost the life to many a brave man, a reaction which
proved once more, the power of inactive and inert substance
against which courage is nothing. Through their
invisible loop holes and under the thick armour of their
shelters immersed in concrete, the few occupants of the
flour-mill soon overpowered the will and determination of
our troops, who were forced to retreat taking away with
them their dead and wounded.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Franco-British offensive could not be continued for
several reasons, and our army resumed the life of the trenches
which still lasted another year.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last there was the liberating offensive.</p>

<p class='c010'>The rapid progress of our troops forced the enemy to
abandon Dixmude. Our soldiers entered there the 29<sup>th</sup> of
September 1918 and settled there till the 15<sup>th</sup> of October,
date of the second rush forward.</p>

<p class='c010'>The town was nothing but a heap of ruins and the flour-mill
a grey shapeless mass, which will perpetuate the
remembrance of this long war and the numerous heroes
fallen there under its blows.</p>

<p class='c005'>The fighting posts and shelters established after the battle
of the Yser, in the ruins of the small buildings along the
embankment, saw little by little their walls relined with a
strong interior casing of concrete, and their lost roofs,
replaced by thick concrete layers also. The house of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>Joconde (so called, because of the good old proprietress,
Mieke Bœuf, who during long weeks of trench warfare still
occupied it and who became quite legendary with our soldiers),
served as a lodging to the Commander of the company
at the bridge-head, till a better appropriated shelter
was built. It was occupied after, by the men of the Royal
engineers, who were charged to keep in good order, the
foot bridges giving access to the bridge-head.</p>

<p class='c010'>The next house to the one of the Joconde’s served as C. P.
to the major on guard.</p>

<p class='c010'>After the organization of the bridge-head (see notice
n<sup>o</sup> 20), an allround plan fortifying the sector was elaborated.
They foresaw the construction of little forts or redoubts
with a distance of 600 meters between each and utilizing
the embankment as a parapet and the Yser as obstacle.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was with the redoubts Albert and Elisabeth that they
began. They were finished in December 1915. The reason
of their existence, was to protect the bridge-head against
enfilading fire; but that was not the only part they played.
These two redoubts completed and formed with the part
of the embankment which bound them together a kind of
curtain which had to hold good, whatever happened.</p>

<p class='c010'>The system and assemblage of fires which shot out from
the numerous loop holes and “embrasures” of their
shelters for machine-guns and rifles gave them an enormous
capacity of resistance.</p>

<p class='c010'>The redoubts Albert and Elisabeth were the work of the

</div>

<p class='c005'>When the Belgian front was stabilized (November 1914),
it was in part covered by floods, before which our posts
soon became powerful main-guards.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>Two well distinctive floods had been spread; the first
during the battle of the Yser, was extended between the
river and the railway line Nieuport-Dixmude having the
paved road Oostkerke kilometer 16 of the Yser as Southern
limit; the second, subsequent to the fall of Dixmude was
created at the request of the French troops from the 14<sup>th</sup> of
November 1914. All the land situated at the East of the
Yser, between the Houtensluisvaart and the road embankment
of Knocke to Drie Grachten was flooded (this was
realised, thanks to the great difference of water level of the
two river-banks. The one on the right bank being inferior
to the one on the left).</p>

<p class='c010'>Between the kilometer 16 of the Yser and Houtensluisvaart
the obstacle of water did not exist. The enemy, at
Dixmude occupied the right bank of the Yser, which alone
separated the adversary lines. At the South of the railway
line of Dixmude to Zarren, the German positions followed
a course almost parallel to the road of Woumen, comprising
the strongly organized points such as the cemetery of
Dixmude, the Castle of kilometer 19 and several farms. Our
troops continued to follow the left bank of the river.</p>

<p class='c010'>After the victory of the Yser, the constant idea of our
staff was to reconquer the most ground possible. The
Belgian army built on all practicable spots; posts of various
degrees of importance, and this principle was applied to
the sector of Nieucappelle on a very large scale.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was decided to establish on the right bank of the
Yser, at the South of Dixmude, towards kilometer 19, to
the close contact of the enemy a bridge-head which would
be afterwards widened, in order to create a starting position
to permit our army to take and offensive. It was Major
Panhuys who was charged with this perilous operation,
with a group composed of his own battalion (the 1<sup>st</sup> battalion
of the 2<sup>d</sup> foot jagers), re-enforced with a company of
machine-gunners and a company of cyclists. It was important
to take the enemy unawares. All was put in action
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>to that end, each one having his definite mission to
accomplish. During the night of the 21<sup>st</sup> to the 22<sup>d</sup> of December
1914, a night cold and dark, the group crossed the river
in two places and managed to instal itself on a position
uniting the little wood of the peninsula of kilometer 19.500
with a bend to the North, facing the cemetery of Dixmude.
The enemy being taken by surprise, could not till dawn offer
an efficient resistance: but already our troops had organized
the ground and maintained their positions in spite of firing,
counter-attacks and severe bombardments.</p>

<p>Bridge-head of kilometer 19.500 of the river Yser in June 1915.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>The heroïc group, who had performed the operation
with such valour and spirit, was mentioned in despatches
by decision of the H. M. the King.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was of the utmost importance to strengthen the
occupation, but there could be no question of working by
day, the enemy holding the watch and sway over the land,
and especially over the knoll of Woumen (castle of kilometer
19). So our troops were kept to the task without
respite.</p>

<p class='c010'>Afterwards the extension of the bridge-head to the South,
for months saw added to the companies on guard, picket
companies and detachments of pioneers, nightly erecting
parapets and communication trenches, building shelters,
casting footbridges over muddy ground, covering the
positions with wire netting work, regulating the current
of the waters at Sparken and Waalevaardeken by locks
and dams, multiplying and rebuilding the footbridges on
the river etc., in a word executing the thousand and one
labours required by an advanced position to render it strong
and powerful, durable if not comfortable and give to the
troops of the principal resisting position real and positive
security.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then, arose the question of progressing towards the East
and towards the North. The works of extension were
commenced, but it was soon realised what a great effort
and incessant sacrifice such an enterprise would demand,
that about Mai 1915 the bridge-head was brought back to
its former line. During the course of the war, the evolution
of fighting methods altered and likewise the mission of the
advanced positions and the effective forces of the garrisons
which held them. For this reason, when the bridge-head
of kilometer 19.500 was created, and which had to resist
to the utmost, it required more than one battalion to guard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>it; and in 1918, a few posts of section or squad sufficed,
the mission of the advanced ones having simply become at
this place, for watching purposes in case of a defensive, or
kick off in the case of an offensive.</p>

<p class='c010'>To give one an exact idea of the enormous effort that the
bridge-head of the kilometer 19 cost, one needed to see the
development and extension it had taken in May 1915 and
be equally penetrated with the idea, that all the work had
been done at the price of heavy losses, although it had
been done by night, under the bullets and shrapnells, in
bad weather and often with reduced means. This bridge-head
contributed greatly to maintain an offensive spirit in
the minds of the infantrymen, it served also as a base to
many patrols towards the enemy’s organizations and notably
to a famous raid on the castle of kilometer 19 on the night
of the 28<sup>th</sup> to the 29<sup>th</sup> of October 1917, which was a brilliant
success, led by Captain Dendal, who brought back materials
and prisoners.</p>

<p class='c010'>Several times the Germans tried to rush the bridge-head
of kilometer 19, but without any result whatever.</p>

<p class='c010'>And then during the offensive of September 1918, it
served as a starting trench to the troops of the Belgian
4<sup>th</sup> division, for the victorious assault which ended by the
liberation of Dixmude.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>21.—Observation-post near the Church of Clercken.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Clercken Ridge was very precious to the enemy to whom
it gave the opportunity to establish a lot of natural observation-posts
which had not the vulnerability of the confined
kite balloons and which assured more stability to the
observation. Many of these posts were destroyed during
the war, especially by the destructive fires which preceded
the great offensive in Flanders on the 28<sup>th</sup> of September 1918.
Others, such as the mill of Clercken, are already rebuilt,
so offer no longer any historical interest.</p>

<p class='c005'>The southern part of the Belgian front may be classed as
one of the most agitated sectors of the Western front. The
short communications of the press which announced in
their brief laconic style: “Bombing actions at het Sas and
at Steenstraat; <a id='t60'></a>duel of artillery in the region of Noordschote”,
said nothing of the horror of certain days of guard
where the blood marked the ground of trenches, a hundred
times turned over and as many times reestablished and
always defended by our heroical troops. Drie Grachten, le
Passeur, Steenstraat, Merckem, all these names resound,
like as many bugle calls proclaiming the heroism of our
soldiers and the glory of our arms.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was in July-October 1917 that the Franco-British
offensive gave us back, in that region, a corner of Belgian
land. A few Belgian units participated on the 27<sup>th</sup> of October
to the last assault which drove the enemy back beyond
Luyghem, Kippe, Aschoop and reached, on the right, the
outskirts of Houthulst forest. The effort had to be followed up,
our troops had to extend to the North of Dixmude, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>progression of the Allies; our artillery preparation was
ended, the Belgian army only waited for the signal!</p>

<p class='c010'>But a run of unfavourable circumstances: the russian
defection, the Caporetto incidents and the continual rain
obliged the allies’ chief staff to suspend the offensive. One
had to be resigned and wait, but it was a great deception
to the Belgian soldier.</p>

<p class='c010'>The 11<sup>th</sup> of November 1917, the 4<sup>th</sup> army division relieved
a French division at Merckem. The state of the field after
the battle, is depicted in the following extract from the
order of the division commander dated the 14<sup>th</sup> of November.
“In order to avoid, during the relieves, the sinking of the
men in the excavations which are hollowed out all over the
track, it is advised to gather the men in groups of five,
holding one to one another with a rope and thus lending
each other mutual help.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Nineteen hundred and seventeen was, in fact, the year
of offensives with long artillery preparations, which
transformed the battle fields into masterpieces of devastation.
The soil ploughed up by thousands of projectiles
formed a vast field of hollows, filled with water by the
autumn rains. Nothing else was seen in this desolate
landscape but a few cut down trunks of trees and the
monstrous concretes of the Germans, which were sometimes
demolished and overturned.</p>

<p class='c010'>However, it was absolutely necessary to remain on the
chaotic ground. The positions had to be established strong
enough to repulse the counter-attacks. At first it was only
a system of shell holes surrounded by blocks of concrete
which had been deserted by the enemy. It was a dreadful
hard winter for the 4<sup>th</sup> army division. When the engineers
and infantrymen at the price of terrible labour, had
repaired and rebuilt the roads and tracks which facilitated
and rendered possible the relieves, the rational and defensive
organization of the sector was undertaken. Successive
lines showed themselves, and were bound between by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>intermediate lines and a well organized plan of defence
was able to be applied.</p>

<p class='c010'>The “Grand-Père” (Grand-father) concrete dug-out,
the remains of which have been preserved, was one of the
posts best known among of the advanced positions of
Merckem. It formed a rather prominent salient which was
always a temptation to the enemy and provoked him to
many sudden attacks, generally preceded by violent
artillery fires demolishing all the surroundings.</p>

<p class='c010'>The 4<sup>th</sup> army division managed to repulse two attempts
and that at two days’ interval: one on the night 26–27 and
the other 28–29 of November 1917. They were more like
trials on the part of the enemy to stake out our advanced
positions.</p>

<p class='c010'>During the occupation of the sector by the 3<sup>d</sup> army
division, the raids became real attacks to reconquer the
“Grand-father”. The 15<sup>th</sup> of February 1918, the enemy was
thrown back in his own lines; but on the 7<sup>th</sup> of March, he
managed to take a footing and bring machine-guns in the
concrete shelter, from where our counter-attacks drove
him out on the evening of the 8<sup>th</sup>.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was decided then, to rectify the advanced line by suppressing
the salient of the grand-father, and also the one,
constituted by three little posts of Aschoop, which also was
subjected to the enemy’s fires.</p>

<p class='c010'>The last german raid on the “Grand-father” was on the
27<sup>th</sup> of March 1918, which hastened the decision, taken on
the 29<sup>th</sup> of the same month, to abandon after destruction
the salients of the Grand-father and Aschoop.</p>

<p class='c010'>The “Grand-father” was again occupied by our troops
the 9<sup>th</sup> of September 1918 after the taking of the german
position of Kwaebeek brook. A centre of resistance was
established there and was occupied till the offensive of the
28<sup>th</sup> of September 1918.</p>

<p class='c010'>The name of <em>Castel Britannia</em> was given to the place
occupied by the enemy’s batteries which oppressed up till
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>1917 our positions of the sector of Steenstraat. Thick concrete
masses protected them. They served under the Belgian
occupation as observation-posts and battle posts.</p>

<p class='c010'>The cross road of <em>Hoekske</em> is situated at the crossing
of Steenstraat to Dixmude road with the road of Merckem.
It marks nearly the centre of the subsector which bears
its name, and is celebrated by the numerous bombardments
it has been subjected to. Heavy pieces of german artillery
have been sunk in its vicinity.</p>

<p class='c005'>These three sites are destined to perpetuate the remembrance
of the defence of Merckem sector, organized by the
4<sup>th</sup> army division at the price of the greatest difficulties
during the winter of 1917, and brilliantly defended by the
3<sup>d</sup> army division in April 1918, and the gallant fields of
action of the 1<sup>st</sup> army division at the time preceding the
offensive of the 28<sup>th</sup> of September. These sites will remain
it that region, the witnesses of the <em>battle of Merckem</em>,
which was fought the 17<sup>th</sup> of April 1918 in the neighbourhood
of Kippe near Langemark, and where the 3<sup>d</sup> army
division, under general Jacques, and the 4<sup>th</sup> army division,
under general Michel, were covered with glory.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Germans, who were in immediate contact with the
3<sup>d</sup> army division at Kippe, made a sudden and abrupt irruption
in the lines of this division and advanced up to the
front of the Merckem and Hoekske trenches, where they
were stopped.</p>

<p class='c010'>Brilliant and heroical counter-attacks cleverly upheld
by the artillery, drove them back disabled in their positions.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the side of the 4<sup>th</sup> army division, the enemy, who,
before approaching the front had to descend the slope at
the North-East-bank of the Broenbeek and although vigorously
welcomed by infantry and artillery fires, managed
to push through a corner between the main-guards of
Champaubert and Montmirail, whose wings were turned
over to form a hook. Held in that way, the efforts of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Germans to open the breach further were vain. Crushed
by violent musketry fires and the precise firing of the
artillery, the enemy could not hold the positions reached
and had to retire.</p>

<p class='c010'>The battle of Merckem which had not procured to the
Germans one atom of land, nor advantage, cost them
many dead and wounded, eight hundred prisoners and the
loss of numerous material, which was left in the hands of
the 3<sup>d</sup> army division. The order of Leopold was granted to
the 9<sup>th</sup> regiment of the line and to the 1<sup>st</sup> jagers.</p>

<p class='c010'>The inscription of “Merckem” on the regimental
Colours of the 3<sup>d</sup> army division, and on those of the 13<sup>th</sup>
and 19<sup>th</sup> of the line (4<sup>th</sup> army division) and also on the
shields of the guns, rewarded the bravery of the troops
who won the battle.</p>

<p class='c010'>As regards the moral point of view, the victory of the
17<sup>th</sup> of April in which our regiments had overthrown whole
divisions of enemies, revealed to the General Staff, the offensive
worth and power of our army and gave to it the full
due, of its conscientiousness and strength and the ardent
desire to go forward.</p>

<p class='c010'>From the 17<sup>th</sup> of April, our soldiers at Merckem felt
themselves masters of the sector. Patrols and audacious
raids were undertaken, sometimes on Kloostermolen, sometimes
on the trenches of the Kwaebeek position or on the
Little-son and on Italy, Portugal and Epernon farms.</p>

<p class='c010'>The numerous prisoners brought back from these expeditions
supplied our Staff with informations, which were
the more interesting because, at that time, the allied armies
had begun to drive back the enemy from the French front.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last, on the 9<sup>th</sup> of September, at dawn, a brilliant
attack was executed without great loss by the 3<sup>d</sup> line
regiment. The position of Kwaebeek, entirely taken,
was organized, and, when a few days later, the enemy
who had recovered, attempted with the aid of great
reinforcement to drive back our troops in their former
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>lines, the success was of short duration, for the enemy
had to let go.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was from the position of Kwaebeek, that the 1st Infantry
division, started the 28<sup>th</sup> of September 1918 to the
signal for the great liberating offensive.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>25.—The big german gun of Leugenboom at Couckelaere near Moere.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Not having succeeded, in spite of their brutal effort and
the use of asphyxiating gas, which till then had never
been made use of, to pierce the front at Steenstraat, in
April 1915, the Germans who had foreseen every thing,
began to bombard Dunkirk, this permitted to their press
to hide the check, to cry out loudly “Victory, our artillery
is bombarding Dunkirk”.</p>

<p class='c010'>A marine gun of 380 mm. installed in a public house
called “In het Predikboom” (kilometer 12<sup>th</sup>, road Dixmude-Poelcappelle)
had just started, to execute its first shot.
That was on the 26<sup>th</sup> of April 1915.</p>

<p class='c010'>A powerful counter-battery action was soon organized
and proved a success. Twice the gun was disabled, the
first time for a period of forty two days and the second
time for forty eight. The 9<sup>th</sup> of August 1915 registered its
last shot.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nevertheless the counter-battery maintained its firing in
order to prevent the Germans rebuilding the place and
arming it.</p>

<p class='c010'>In October 1916, an extraordinary activity was shown
at the former emplacement of Predikboom. Numerous and
deliberate firings were executed by the counter-batteries;
and one might well ask if this German activity was not a
new dodge. Another place, in fact was being built at
Leugenboom (3200 meters to the North of Couckelaere).</p>

<p class='c010'>The emplacement of Leugenboom was noted for the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>time the 7<sup>th</sup> of May 1917 by Captain Jaumotte while
making one of his aerial reconnoitrings. He took a photograph
of it, which clearly showed the advanced state of
the works, the switch line, grafted on a point to a normal
gauge, thus forming the junction at Eerneghem,
to the state railway line Ostend-Thourout.</p>

<p class='c010'>Without a doubt the firing on Dunkirk was going to
begin again.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Belgian artillery staff, started at once a plan of action
against that urgent threat. The said staff obtained of the
36<sup>th</sup> French army corps, which was operating on the
Belgian front the aid of two guns of A. L. V. F. (artillerie
lourde sur voie ferrée, i. e. Heavy railway battery) two
magnificent naval guns of 305 (12 inch.).</p>

<p class='c010'>These two pieces will be the soul of the counter-battery,
they will be upheld in their action by a special group of
numerous heavy batteries which will make opposition on
all german batteries opening fire on the two heavy guns.</p>

<p class='c010'>The plan was prepared, but to realise it, important and
preliminary works had to be executed, which took five days
after Captain Jaumotte’s reconnoitring.</p>

<p class='c010'>These works consisted thus: first of all, the building
of firing emplacements for the heavy artillery; establishing
many telephone connections, needed since the creation of
the special group, connections which had to perform not
only the centralisation of the command, but also a perfect
understanding between the director of the firing, the
batteries and the observation-posts and the cross registering
section, as well as the creation of antennas to receive
the messages of aerial observations.</p>

<p class='c010'>The railway battalion, pushed on after three days of
splendid and extraordinary efforts, the works sufficiently
far to render the point of Eggewaertscappelle capable of
bearing the firing of the heavy guns. The group of telegraphists
and telephonists accomplished at the same time, grand
and important works of liaison, which altogether constituted
the tool of the firing director.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>A firing program was elaborated, a program which led the
action on Leugenboom and on the Tirpitz battery (see
site n<sup>o</sup> 4) at the same time. The firing on the Tirpitz was
assured by two heavy guns of 305 in position on the point
of Coxyde-Bains.</p>

<p class='c010'>The 13<sup>th</sup> of May, the two heavy guns of 305 were brought
to the place of firing which had been chosen—the switch-point
of Eggewaertscappelle—and a nice clear day was
waited to open action. That beautiful day was longed for
right up to the 20<sup>th</sup> of May 1917.</p>

<p class='c010'>The execution of the genuine program was preceded by
an independant firing directed on the German observation-post
installed in the belfry of Eessen, with a 240 (10 inch.)
gun in position at the East of Burg Molen, upheld by the
special group. The tower was partially demolished.</p>

<p class='c010'>About 11 o’clock, the heavy guns of 305 of Eggewaertscappelle
fired their first shot on Leugenboom, while the
gun of Burg Molen continued its demolishing and blinding
work on the enemy’s observation-post. A little while after
the guns of Coxyde-Bains entered in action in their turn
against Tirpitz battery. The observation of these firings
were both terrestrial and aerial.</p>

<p class='c010'>The firing program was continued the following days
when the weather was favourable for observation.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the 25<sup>th</sup> of May, an aerial photograph of Leugenboom
position was taken. It did not disclose the least damage to
the concrete block, but its clearness sufficiently noted
the gun carriage not yet armed, in the centre of the
honeycomb which formed the platform.</p>

<p class='c010'>In order to parry, as might be the case, to a more accurate
enemy counter-battery, the railway battalion built or
layed out sucessively several sites for heavy artillery firing.
It is so, that two sites on the switch point of Eggewaertscappelle,
a third at the station of Moerhoek and a fourth
on the point of Isenberghe, served as reserve, and were
occupied in turns.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Leugenboom heavy gun entered in action the 27<sup>th</sup> of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>June 1917. Between 5 and 10 o’clock, it bombarded Malo-on-sea
and Dunkirk. This first action made numerous victims.
The shells were of 380 mm.</p>

<p class='c010'>One shell, amongst others, the first, it is thought, fell on
the Casino of Malo, where the general staff of the XV<sup>th</sup> British
army corps was established: it made twenty four victims,
eleven dead and thirteen wounded.</p>

<p class='c010'>In July 1917, there were several bombardments to be
noted on different objectives: Furnes, Dunkirk, Coxyde,
Forthem and Alveringhem.</p>

<p class='c010'>The bombardments of Dunkirk, threatening to become
very frequent, alarmed the authorities, and it was decided
from the 19<sup>th</sup> of July 1917 to create two direct telephone
lines at different courses which would join Dunkirk to the
Pervyse railway station observation-post, which was particularly
well situated.</p>

<p class='c010'>The starting shots of Leugenboom, heard at the railway
station at Pervyse, were in that way instantly communicated
to Dunkirk, where the reception posts gave the alert
to the town by powerful horns and other alarm engines,
thus permitting the population to take refuge in the
concrete shelters specially built for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c010'>In spite of the well studied counter-battery, the Leugenboom
gun still continued firing. The lulls, which lasted
often long time, gave the hope that a positive result had
been obtained. Then after a lapse of one and sometimes two
months, the rage of the Germans revived and Dunkirk was
again subjected to further attacks.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1918, bombardments were very frequent. At certain
times, they became even daily, but Dunkirk was not
always the objective. In May and notably in June, the firing
of Leugenboom was directed on Klein-Leysele and the
27<sup>th</sup> of September 1918 on Bergues.</p>

<p class='c010'>The offensive of Flanders, at last lights up. But the
enraged Germans will hold on till the last minute.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is only on the 16<sup>th</sup> of October at 20 minutes to three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>that the heavy cannon of Leugenboom is for ever silenced.
In its last spasms of agony it dealt terrible blows to the
localities situated behind the front of attack.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last on the 17<sup>th</sup> of October the monster of Leugenboom
belongs to us. Our troops neared it, and, passing by it,
threw a slightly haughtly look, but certainly encouraged by
their grand trophy. Pressed by our soldiers, the Germans
had hastily attempted to put their cannon out of action. It
was loaded and levelled horizontally, and so it remains to
the present day. In that position they hoped that the projectile
would touch the concrete mass before being entirely
shot out of the tube, and that its bursting would blow up
the flight. But their anticipations were not realised; the
projectile, instead of being stopped by the mass of concrete,
passed through it, making a breach and burst about
800 meters further.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a Krupp marine gun of 380 mm. (15 inch),
type 1914, n<sup>o</sup> 154, of a total length of 17 m. 13 placed on a
gun carriage, formed by two formidable tanks, tap rooted
in the centre of a concrete pit. This pit has a special shape
because, of the conditions the constructors imposed themselves
to give it a field of <a id='t69'></a>fire of 157°, the axis of which
passes by Dunkirk.</p>

<p class='c010'>The total weight of the piece is 77630 kilos.</p>

<p class='c010'>The breech has an outer diameter of one meter, the
manœuvre is electrical but there exists handles for hand
manœuvring. The artillery men were entirely protected by
a cabin joined to the gun carriage, built in strong sheet
of iron of a thickness of about 50 mm.</p>

<p class='c010'>The cannon fired a projectile of 750 kilogrammes.</p>

<p class='c010'>The two heavy guns of Predikboom and Leugenboom
subjected Dunkirk to thirty two bombardments, the four
hundred and eleven 15 inches shells of which killed one
hundred and fourteen persons and wounded one hundred
and eighty five.</p>
